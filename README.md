# Mimicry_snakes
Codes of the study "Looking for mimicry in Western Palearctic snakes"

## Codes used
### Training of the DNNs on the venomous snakes and predictions for non-venomous snakes images:
Training_and_prediction_DNNs.py

### creation of the null distribution and detection of mimicry:
Test_mimicry_null_distribution.R

### Prediction for the images with exchanged background:
Prediction_background_exchanged_images.py

### test of the effect of background exchange:
Test_invariance_background_exchange.R

## Data location
Are available are available on Dryad [here](Http:....)
  - the prediction made by the 15 averaged DNNs for the non-venomous snakes species
  - the matrix of sympatry between venomous and non-venomous species
  - the prediction made by the 15 averaged DNNs for the images with a background exchanged
